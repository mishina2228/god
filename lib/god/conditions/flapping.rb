    # Condition Symbol :flapping
    # Type: Trigger
    #
    # Trigger when a Task transitions to or from a state or states a given number
    # of times within a given period.
    #
    # Parameters
    #   Required
    #     +times+ is the number of times that the Task must transition before
    #             triggering.
    #     +within+ is the number of seconds within which the Task must transition
    #              the specified number of times before triggering. You may use
    #              the sugar methods #seconds, #minutes, #hours, #days to clarify
    #              your code (see examples).
    #     --one or both of--
    #     +from_state+ is the state (as a Symbol) from which the transition must occur.
    #     +to_state is the state (as a Symbol) to which the transition must occur.
    #
    #   Optional:
    #     +retry_in+ is the number of seconds after which to re-monitor the Task after
    #                it has been disabled by the condition.
    #     +retry_times+ is the number of times after which to permanently unmonitor
    #                   the Task.
    #     +retry_within+ is the number of seconds within which
